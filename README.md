# Text Classification with Naive Bayes

## Project Overview

This project implements a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It categorizes text into one of four categories: atheism, Christianity, computer graphics, and medicine. The project demonstrates the basic workflow of a machine learning text classification task, from data loading to model evaluation and prediction.

## Features

- Utilizes the 20 Newsgroups dataset for training and testing
- Implements text preprocessing and vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy score
- Provides a function to classify new, unseen text inputs

## Prerequisites

- Anaconda (Python 3.8 or later)
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new Anaconda environment
3.  Activate the environment
4.  Install required packages

## Usage 

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook
2. Open the notebook

3. Run all cells in the notebook to:
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train the Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Test the model with new text inputs

4. Modify the `new_text` variable at the end of the notebook to classify your own text examples

## Project Structure

-  Main Jupyter notebook containing the project code
- `README.md`: This file, providing project information and instructions

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8
- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and data processing
- numpy: For numerical computations
- pandas: For data manipulation (not extensively used in this project, but commonly used in data science)
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code development and visualization

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced text preprocessing techniques (e.g., removing stop words, stemming)
- Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
- Add cross-validation for more robust model evaluation
- Create a simple web interface for real-time text classification
